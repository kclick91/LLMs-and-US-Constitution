Here are 12 major U.S. Supreme Court cases and their decisions. Each of these cases had a profound impact on American law and society.

***

### **1. Marbury v. Madison (1803)**

This landmark case established **judicial review**, the Supreme Court's power to declare a law unconstitutional. Chief Justice John Marshall, writing for the unanimous court, ruled that while William Marbury had a right to his commission as a justice of the peace, the Court did not have the original jurisdiction to issue the writ he requested. Marshall's decision skillfully asserted the Court's authority as the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution without creating a direct conflict with the executive branch.

### **2. McCulloch v. Maryland (1819)**

The Court unanimously ruled that Congress had the power to establish a national bank, and the state of Maryland could not tax it. This decision solidified the doctrine of **implied powers** under the "Necessary and Proper Clause" of the Constitution, which grants Congress the authority to make laws that are necessary to carry out its enumerated powers. Chief Justice Marshall famously declared, "the power to tax involves the power to destroy," establishing the supremacy of federal law over state law.

### **3. Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857)** üò•

In a deeply controversial decision, the Court ruled that enslaved or formerly enslaved people were not citizens and had no right to sue in federal court. The Court also found the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional, stating that Congress could not prohibit slavery in U.S. territories. This ruling intensified the national debate over slavery and is widely considered one of the worst decisions in the Court's history.

### **4. Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)**

This case established the doctrine of "**separate but equal**," which became the legal basis for racial segregation for nearly 60 years. The Court upheld a Louisiana law requiring segregated train cars, arguing that the law didn't violate the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause as long as the facilities were equal. In his famous dissent, Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote, "Our Constitution is color-blind."

### **5. Gideon v. Wainwright (1963)**

The Court ruled unanimously that the Sixth Amendment's right to legal counsel must be provided to indigent (poor) defendants in felony cases at the state level. The decision established the principle that a fair trial cannot be guaranteed without legal representation, and the state must provide a lawyer to those who cannot afford one.

***

### **6. Miranda v. Arizona (1966)** üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This decision created the requirement that police must inform suspects of their constitutional rights before custodial interrogation. The Court held that the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination and the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel required police to read suspects their "Miranda rights," including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.

***

### **7. Tinker v. Des Moines School Dist. (1969)**

The Court ruled that students do not "shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate." The case centered on students who wore black armbands to protest the Vietnam War. The decision affirmed students' **First Amendment** rights in school, as long as their expression doesn't cause a "material and substantial disruption" to the educational environment.

***

### **8. Roe v. Wade (1973)**

The Court ruled that a woman's right to an abortion was protected by the **right to privacy** under the Fourteenth Amendment. The decision established a trimester framework, granting states more regulatory power as the pregnancy progressed. While the decision was later overturned in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* (2022), it remains one of the most significant and debated rulings in U.S. history.

***

### **9. Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978)**

This case addressed affirmative action. The Court ruled that while the university's strict **racial quota** system was unconstitutional, the use of race as one of several factors in admissions decisions was permissible. The decision was a compromise that allowed affirmative action to continue, but only in a limited and carefully considered way.

***

### **10. Texas v. Johnson (1989)**

The Court ruled that burning the American flag is a form of **symbolic speech** protected by the First Amendment. The decision overturned the conviction of Gregory Lee Johnson, who had burned a flag in protest of the Reagan administration. The Court held that the government could not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society found the idea offensive or disagreeable.

***

### **11. Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010)**

The Court ruled that corporations and unions have the same **First Amendment** rights as individuals. The decision held that the government couldn't restrict their independent political spending in candidate elections. This ruling led to the creation of "super PACs" and has had a massive impact on campaign finance, allowing for unlimited spending by outside groups.

***

### **12. Obergefell v. Hodges (2015)** üåà

The Court ruled that same-sex marriage is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the **Fourteenth Amendment**. This landmark decision legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, requiring all states to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and to recognize such marriages performed in other states.

Gemini
Here are the 12 major U.S. Supreme Court cases and the constitutional clauses most and least heavily weighed in each decision.

***

### **1. Marbury v. Madison (1803)**
* **Most Heavily Weighed:** Article III, Section 2 (original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court) and Article VI, Clause 2 (Supremacy Clause). The Court's ruling on its own jurisdiction and its power to interpret the Constitution were central.
* **Least Heavily Weighed:** The specifics of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which the Court declared unconstitutional.

### **2. McCulloch v. Maryland (1819)**
* **Most Heavily Weighed:** Article I, Section 8, Clause 18 (the Necessary and Proper Clause) and Article VI, Clause 2 (Supremacy Clause). The ruling hinged on the implied powers of Congress and the supremacy of federal law.
* **Least Heavily Weighed:** The Tenth Amendment (states' rights), as the Court held that federal law was supreme.

### **3. Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857)**
* **Most Heavily Weighed:** Article III (jurisdiction of the Court) and the Fifth Amendment (Due Process Clause). The Court argued that enslaved people were not citizens and that the Missouri Compromise unconstitutionally deprived slaveholders of their property.
* **Least Heavily Weighed:** The Preamble, which begins with "We the People," and the Declaration of Independence's principle that all men are created equal.

### **4. Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)**
* **Most Heavily Weighed:** The Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The majority ruled that "separate but equal" did not violate this clause.
* **Least Heavily Weighed:** The Thirteenth Amendment (abolition of slavery). The Court argued segregation was a social distinction, not a continuation of servitude.

### **5. Gideon v. Wainwright (1963)**
* **Most Heavily Weighed:** The Sixth Amendment (right to counsel) and the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The Court used the Fourteenth Amendment to "incorporate" the Sixth Amendment's right to the states.
* **Least Heavily Weighed:** The Tenth Amendment (states' rights), as the federal government was compelling states to provide legal counsel.

### **6. Miranda v. Arizona (1966)**
* **Most Heavily Weighed:** The Fifth Amendment (protection against self-incrimination) and the Sixth Amendment (right to an attorney). The ruling created a requirement to protect these rights during police custody.
* **Least Heavily Weighed:** The Fourth Amendment (search and seizure). The case focused on self-incrimination, not the legality of obtaining evidence.

### **7. Tinker v. Des Moines School Dist. (1969)**
* **Most Heavily Weighed:** The First Amendment (freedom of speech). The decision established that students' rights to expression are protected in school.
* **Least Heavily Weighed:** The Tenth Amendment (states' rights), as the federal court was regulating the actions of a local school district.

### **8. Roe v. Wade (1973)**
* **Most Heavily Weighed:** The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The Court found a "right to privacy" within this clause that protected a woman's right to an abortion.
* **Least Heavily Weighed:** The Tenth Amendment (states' rights) and the Equal Protection Clause. The ruling was not focused on equal protection but on the right to privacy.

### **9. Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978)**
* **Most Heavily Weighed:** The Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Court used these to strike down racial quotas while allowing race to be a factor in admissions.
* **Least Heavily Weighed:** The Tenth Amendment (states' rights), as the federal government was regulating state university admissions.

### **10. Texas v. Johnson (1989)**
* **Most Heavily Weighed:** The First Amendment (freedom of speech). The Court ruled that flag burning was a protected form of symbolic speech.
* **Least Heavily Weighed:** The Preamble and the concept of "patriotism." The Court explicitly stated that the government could not restrict speech simply because it was offensive.

### **11. Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010)**
* **Most Heavily Weighed:** The First Amendment (freedom of speech). The Court ruled that corporations and unions have free speech rights and that restricting their independent political spending was unconstitutional.
* **Least Heavily Weighed:** The Tenth Amendment (states' rights) or Article II (Electoral College). The ruling was focused on free speech, not the electoral process itself.

### **12. Obergefell v. Hodges (2015)**
* **Most Heavily Weighed:** The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. The Court ruled that both clauses guaranteed the right to marry to same-sex couples.
* **Least Heavily Weighed:** The Tenth Amendment (states' rights) or First Amendment (freedom of religion). The Court's focus was on marriage as a fundamental right, not on states' ability to regulate it or on religious objections.
