The United States Constitution is the supreme law of the United States. It is the world's oldest and longest-surviving written charter of government. It was written in 1787 and ratified in 1788, and it has been in operation since 1789. The Constitution is divided into a Preamble, seven articles, and 27 amendments.

### Articles of the Constitution

The first three articles of the Constitution establish the three branches of the federal government and outline their powers and responsibilities.

* **Article I: The Legislative Branch**
    * Creates a bicameral (two-house) Congress, consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives.
    * Defines the powers of Congress, including the ability to make laws, declare war, raise an army, and regulate commerce.
    * Outlines the requirements for serving in Congress and the legislative process for bills to become law.

* **Article II: The Executive Branch**
    * Establishes the office of the President and Vice President.
    * Defines the powers of the executive branch, including serving as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, making treaties, and appointing federal judges and other officials.
    * Outlines the process for electing the President via the Electoral College and the requirements for the office.

* **Article III: The Judicial Branch**
    * Establishes the Supreme Court as the highest court in the federal judicial system.
    * Gives Congress the power to create lower federal courts.
    * Specifies that federal judges are appointed for life unless they are removed for serious misconduct.

The remaining articles cover various aspects of the government and the nation:

* **Article IV: The States**
    * Defines the relationship between the states and the federal government.
    * Requires states to respect the laws and legal proceedings of other states.
    * Outlines the process for admitting new states to the Union.

* **Article V: The Amendment Process**
    * Describes the process by which the Constitution can be changed or amended.
    * Amendments can be proposed by a two-thirds vote of both the House and the Senate, or by a national convention called for by two-thirds of the state legislatures.
    * Proposed amendments must be ratified by three-fourths of the state legislatures or state conventions.

* **Article VI: Supremacy and Debts**
    * Establishes the Constitution and federal laws as the "supreme Law of the Land," taking precedence over conflicting state laws.
    * Requires all federal and state officials to swear an oath to support the Constitution.

* **Article VII: Ratification**
    * Explains the process for ratifying the Constitution, which required the approval of nine of the 13 original states.

### The Bill of Rights

The Bill of Rights consists of the first ten amendments to the Constitution. It was added in 1791 to guarantee specific protections of individual liberty and place clear limits on the power of the federal government.

* **1st Amendment:** Protects freedom of religion, speech, the press, peaceful assembly, and the right to petition the government.
* **2nd Amendment:** Protects the right of the people to keep and bear arms.
* **3rd Amendment:** Prohibits the forced quartering of soldiers in private homes without the owner's consent.
* **4th Amendment:** Protects against unreasonable searches and seizures and requires warrants to be based on probable cause.
* **5th Amendment:** Guarantees several rights for those accused of crimes, including the right to a grand jury indictment, protection against double jeopardy (being tried twice for the same crime), and the right against self-incrimination ("pleading the fifth"). It also guarantees due process of law and just compensation for private property taken for public use.
* **6th Amendment:** Guarantees the right to a speedy and public trial, the right to an impartial jury, the right to be informed of the charges, and the right to an attorney.
* **7th Amendment:** Guarantees the right to a jury trial in civil cases.
* **8th Amendment:** Prohibits excessive bail and fines, as well as cruel and unusual punishments.
* **9th Amendment:** States that the enumeration of certain rights in the Constitution does not mean that other rights not specifically listed are not also protected.
* **10th Amendment:** Reinforces the principle of federalism by stating that any powers not specifically given to the federal government, nor withheld from the states, are reserved to those states or the people.

### Other Amendments

Since the Bill of Rights, 17 additional amendments have been ratified, addressing a wide range of issues. Key amendments include:

* **13th Amendment (1865):** Abolished slavery and involuntary servitude.
* **14th Amendment (1868):** Granted citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States and guaranteed equal protection of the laws and due process to all citizens.
* **15th Amendment (1870):** Prohibited the denial of the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude.
* **19th Amendment (1920):** Granted women the right to vote.
* **22nd Amendment (1951):** Limited the President to two terms in office.
