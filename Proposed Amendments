Here are **10 proposed amendments** to the U.S. Constitution that came fairly close to being ratified or otherwise had significant momentum, along with what they would have done and why they failed (or are still in limbo). If you like, I can also include a few more that were less close but interesting.

| **1. Equal Rights Amendment (ERA)**                                                     | Would guarantee equality of rights under the law regardless of sex.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Passed both houses of Congress in 1972 and sent to the states. By 1977, **35 states** had ratified. It needed **38**. Congress set a deadline (later extended) which expired in 1982 without the needed states ratifying. Some states ratified afterwards (e.g. Virginia in 2020) but legal questions remain about whether they count given the deadline. ([Equal Rights Amendment][1])                               |                                                        |
| **2. Flag Desecration Amendment**                                                       | Would give Congress power to prohibit the physical desecration of the U.S. flag (i.e. override Supreme Court rulings that flag burning is protected speech).                                                                                                                                                                                      | Nearly passed. The House passed it multiple times with comfortable margins. In the Senate, it fell short by a few votes (e.g. 63-37 in 1995, when 67 needed). So it didn’t clear the two-thirds required. ([Wikipedia][2])                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                        |
| **3. Titles of Nobility Amendment**                                                     | Would strip U.S. citizenship from any citizen who accepted a title of nobility, office, or gift from a foreign power without Congressional approval.                                                                                                                                                                                              | Proposed in 1810. It got 12 state ratifications fairly quickly, but there were more states needed. It has never reached the required number. Because no time limit was set, it is still technically “pending,” though its practical prospects are remote. ([NPR][3])                                                                                                                                                  |                                                        |
| **4. Child Labor Amendment**                                                            | Would give Congress explicit constitutional authority to regulate labor of persons under eighteen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Proposed in 1924. Many states ratified in the 1920s and ’30s, but it never achieved enough. After the Fair Labor Standards Act (1938) was passed and upheld by courts, interest lapsed. Still unratified and pending (no time limit originally). ([Wikipedia][4])                                                                                                                                                     |                                                        |
| **5. Congressional Apportionment Amendment**                                            | Would set a formula for how many representatives there should be in the House relative to population (one representative per so many inhabitants, scaling up).                                                                                                                                                                                    | Proposed in 1789 as part of Madison’s first set of amendments. Almost ratified: by the end of 1791, it was just one state short. No time limit was set. It remains one of the unratified amendments. ([Wikipedia][5])                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                        |
| **6. One-vote short flag amendment (another version)**                                  | Same goal (flag protection), but some of the Senate votes came within one vote of the needed supermajority.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | For example, in the 2005-06 period, vote-counters thought they'd have support from 66 senators (one less than needed). It still failed to reach the required two-thirds. ([Deseret News][6])                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                        |
| **7. The First Congress’ “Missing” Two from the Bill of Rights**                        | The original 12 amendments Madison proposed in 1789 included two that were not ratified then. One related to Congress not increasing its own pay until after an election (this one eventually became the 27th Amendment in 1992). The other was to regulate the ratio of representation in the House (that is the Apportionment Amendment above). | The “pay raise delay” amendment languished for over 200 years before being ratified as the 27th Amendment in 1992; the apportionment one still not ratified. ([NPR][3])                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                        |
| **8. Amendments to Extend / Reinforce Voting Rights**                                   | Various amendments have been proposed (beyond ones already passed) to more strongly protect or expand voting rights, e.g. for DC residents, for elections without poll taxes, etc. Some got far in Congress or state legislatures.                                                                                                                | A concrete example: The 24th Amendment successfully banned the poll tax, but other proposed amendments (for example, about representation in DC or automatic voter registration) have had traction but not enough for constitutional amendment. Also, the movement around the ERA is often grouped with voting rights reform. (Less specific but shows this theme repeatedly comes close.) ([Constitution Center][7]) |                                                        |
| **9. Amendment Proposals Related to Presidential Term / Succession / Election Process** | Various proposals for reforming the presidency (term limits, clearer succession, or changing how elections are conducted) have been floated repeatedly.                                                                                                                                                                                           | Some of these have passed one chamber or had widespread support in committees, but none have made the final 3/4 ratification. For example, albeit not as close as ERA or flag amendment, there’s been discussion of term limits for Supreme Court justices, or modifying the role of the Electoral College, but these haven’t made it far enough. ([Constitution Center][7])                                          |                                                        |
| **10. Amendment to regulate environmental or “right to clean environment”**             | Proposals have been made to guarantee citizens a right to a pollution-free or clean environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | These have never passed Congress with 2/3 or gotten near state ratification. They are more speculative, though sometimes mentioned in lists of “almost passed” proposals. They show how broader social issues sometimes nearly break through. ([The Washington Post][8])                                                                                                                                              |                                                        |

If you want, I can rank them by how close (in votes or number of states) they got, or focus on particular themes (e.g. civil rights, flag, etc.).
